# weather-Data-Viz
is a project I implemented in the course of a internship at the Centre for Visual Analytics, Science and Technology (CVAST) which is part of the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien),Faculty of Informatics, Institute of Visual Computing and Human-Centered Technology. 

This is my first Implementation using d3.js (https://d3js.org/) 
The Dataset i worked with was derived from https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data
